RISKSISK creates an interactive educational platform between people.
A user of this website has access to unlimited amount of solved questions with appropriate and achievable solutions.
this is done via a lot of different domains under and above the sky. We call these domains Gangs. 
Gangs are the different sectors into which a question is segregated into, which in turn makes it very easy for our users to use and browse questions.

This is mostly due to the overload of all kinds of data on the internet. A website is very much in need because of this very same reason, which can help segregate the unwanted data from the useful data.
